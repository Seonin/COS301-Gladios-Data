All the files used to create the JAR file.

There is a sample of how to create a DataInterface, in the Main.java file.
There is also a telnetServer.java which needs to be run before you use our data files,

this is the only way we could implement it to allow us to test.

It is used as the connection with flink, and allows the data to be streamed from that socket. So it is possible for you to
change the host to your server and port, but you may encounter errors.
